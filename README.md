# SokobanRL

This repository contains the implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as On-policy Monte Carlo, Off-Policy Monte Carlo, Q-Learning, SARSA, and REINFORCE on a popular Japanese video game, Sokoban. Sokoban is a puzzle video game where the player, acting as a warehouse keeper, pushes boxes around in a warehouse to get them to designated storage locations. The game, designed by Hiroyuki Imabayashi in 19811, involves navigating walls and other obstacles, and only one box can be pushed at a time.

A minimalistic graphical view was designed to visualize the games. Here, W represents a unit of the wall, F represents a unit of the floor, A represents our agent (warehouse keeper), B represents the box, and G represents the goal location.
